Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a model organism that has emerged as a tool for cancer
research, cancer being the second most common cause of death after cardiovascular
disease for humans in the developed world. Zebrafish is a useful model for
xenotransplantation of human cancer cells and toxicity studies of different
chemotherapeutic compounds in vivo. Compared to the murine model, the zebrafish
model is faster, can be screened using high-throughput methods and has a lower
maintenance cost, making it possible and affordable to create personalized therapies.

While several methods for cell proliferation determination based on image acquisition
and quantification have been developed, some drawbacks still remain. In the
xenotransplantation technique, quantification of cellular proliferation in vivo is critical to
standardize the process for future preclinical applications of the model.

Quantification of cellular proliferation in vivo is performed through image processing
with the ZFtool toolbox. ZFtool can establish a base threshold that
eliminates embryo auto-fluorescence and measures the area of marked cells (GFP)
and the intensity of those cells to define a 'proliferation index'.
